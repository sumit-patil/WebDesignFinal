WELCOME TO CHICAGO
Chicago’s colorful fall months deliver nothing short of magical experiences. During the autumn season, a Chicago getaway means abundant sunshine while you shop the Magnificent Mile, fresh crisp air during your stroll through Millennium Park, and comfortable cool temps as you tour the incredible sights and architectural treasures.

Experience a city buzzing with energy in the vibrant downtown and colorful neighborhoods. Whether you're visiting for business or pleasure, you will find world-class dining, shopping, entertainment, and hotels and accommodations here in the largest and most-visited city in the Midwest.

If you are looking for things to do in Chicago, look no further. Enjoy the great outdoors with a Chicago Architecture Foundation river boat tour; a play date with the animals at Lincoln Park Zoo; or an alfresco lunch with the stellar skyline in view on a rooftop patio. Indoors, unwind at a leisurely pace at a luxurious spa, or lounge about with the stellar skyline in view and cocktails in hand. For a more action-packed Chicago outing, hit up a game (pro teams like the Bulls, Blackhawks and Bears are in full swing), or make it a wild night out at a comedy club or piano bar.

The fall season is ripe for arts and culture as well. Immerse yourself in the vibrant theater scene at Steppenwolf, Goodman or Broadway in Chicago. Explore museums and galleries of every variety, like the beloved Shedd Aquarium and esteemed Art Institute of Chicago. And take in sensational performances — from live music, comedy, dance and opera.
